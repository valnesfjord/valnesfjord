**Rust. Node.js. A bit of chaos. Lots of cats.**

> I build backend systems like I adopt stray kittens — with patience, structure, and a plan for recovery.

## ⚡ TL;DR

- Backend / systems developer — Rust, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, gRPC, multithreading, caching.
- Designing scalable, fault-tolerant systems is my comfort zone.
- Good architecture isn't a buzzword — it's a necessity.
- Also explored ML, blockchain (Solana, Solidity), automation, Telegram Mini Apps.
- Cats > frameworks.

## 🚀 Highlighted Project

### [`vtg`](https://github.com/valnesfjord/vtg) — write once, run on VK & Telegram

- Unified abstraction layer for two wildly different APIs
- Message longpoll / callback handling in one clean interface
- Minimal boilerplate, maximum portability
- Ideal for multi-platform bots with shared logic

> Write once. Deploy everywhere. Pet cat.

## 🧠 Engineering Mindset

- Code should **survive** failure, not avoid it  
- Abstractions are okay — when you control them  
- Everything has a plan B (and plan C)  
- Systems aren’t smart — but they can be reliable
- Recovery plans for everything (including myself)

```
[✔] Code that survives a panic
[✔] Cached writes that don't duplicate
[✔] Bot that works in prod and test with same config
[✔] Cat on the keyboard while deploying

*No frameworks were harmed in the making of these systems. Several cats were hugged though.*
