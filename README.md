**Rust. Node.js. A bit of chaos. Lots of cats.**

> I build backend systems like I adopt stray kittens — with patience, structure, and a plan for recovery.

```
                     |\_/|                  
                     (. .)    =^.^=         
                   ==> 🐾 <==  code & cats    
```

## TL;DR

- Backend / systems developer — Rust, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, gRPC, multithreading, caching.
- Designing scalable, fault-tolerant systems is my comfort zone.
- Good architecture isn't a buzzword — it's a necessity.
- Also explored ML, blockchain (Solana, Solidity), automation, Telegram Mini Apps.
- Cats > frameworks.

## Highlighted Project

### [`vtg`](https://github.com/valnesfjord/vtg) — write once, run on VK & Telegram

- Unified abstraction layer for two wildly different APIs
- Message longpoll / callback handling in one clean interface
- Minimal boilerplate, maximum portability
- Ideal for multi-platform bots with shared logic

## Tech Stack

```txt
Languages: Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python
Backend:   Rust (actix-rs), Node.js, REST APIs, gRPC, MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL
Storage:   MongoDB, PostgreSQL, custom formats
Async:     tokio, threads, queues, locks, retry logic
Infra:     Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Nginx
Other:     CLI tools, low-level data flows, Telegram Mini Apps
Fun:       Building internal tools I’ll never publish but deeply love
```

## Engineering Mindset

- Build systems that **works gracefully**
- Don’t rely on retry loops — rely on thought-out flows
- Data > abstractions
- Consistency > cleverness
- Recovery plans for everything (including myself)

> “If your code survives a crash, it deserves a treat.”

## Mood Board

```
[✔] Code that survives a panic
[✔] Cached writes that don't duplicate
[✔] Bot that works in prod and test with same config
[✔] Cat on the keyboard while deploying
```

*No frameworks were harmed in the making of these systems. Several cats were hugged though.*
